# This is a placeholder for the WebP version of hero-traveler.svg
# The actual WebP file should be created by converting the SVG to WebP format
# for better performance and smaller file size
# 
# You can convert the SVG to WebP using:
# - Online tools like CloudConvert
# - Image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP
# - Command line tools like ImageMagick or cwebp
#
# The WebP version should maintain the same visual quality while being smaller in file size
