# eSIM Delivery System - Issues Analysis & Fixes

## Overview
Based on the analysis of the webhook logs and codebase, I identified several critical issues in the eSIM delivery system and implemented comprehensive fixes.

## Issues Found

### 1. Guest User Creation Failure
**Issue**: The webhook controller was failing to create guest users with the error:
```
Could not find the 'first_name' column of 'users' in the schema cache
```

**Root Cause**: 
- The users table schema had `first_name` and `last_name` columns, but there were RLS policy conflicts
- Multiple conflicting migrations caused schema inconsistencies
- Service role permissions were not properly configured

**Impact**: 
- Orders from guest users (non-registered customers) were failing
- User_orders entries couldn't be created, breaking order tracking
- Email delivery was still working due to fallback mechanisms

### 2. Package ID Mapping Issues
**Issue**: Original package IDs were causing 500 errors from Roamify API:
```
Error with package e0213ea4-e628-47a3-890b-af781a984be3: 500 Internal Server Error
```

**Root Cause**:
- Package IDs in the local database weren't properly mapped to valid Roamify package IDs
- Some packages had incorrect or expired Roamify package IDs
- The fallback mechanism was working but indicated underlying data issues

**Impact**:
- System had to use fallback packages instead of customer-selected packages
- Customers might receive different packages than what they ordered
- Potential pricing/feature mismatches

### 3. Webhook Idempotency
**Issue**: Webhooks were being processed multiple times:
```
Event evt_3RgujoDEHnCVTkPq0or94ksw already processed
```

**Root Cause**:
- The `processed_events` table existed but policies weren't properly configured
- Multiple webhook attempts for the same event weren't being handled gracefully

**Impact**:
- Risk of duplicate orders or charges
- Unnecessary API calls to Roamify
- Potential customer confusion

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Guest User Schema Fix
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250104000000_final_guest_user_schema_fix.sql`

**Changes**:
- Added `first_name` and `last_name` columns if they don't exist
- Created comprehensive guest user with all required fields
- Fixed RLS policies to allow service role full access to users table
- Ensured proper foreign key constraints for user_orders

**Key Features**:
```sql
-- Ensure columns exist
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_name VARCHAR(255);

-- Create guest user with proper data
INSERT INTO users (id, email, password, first_name, last_name, role)
VALUES ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', 'guest@esimal.com', 'disabled-account', 'Guest', 'User', 'user');

-- Grant service role full access
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role full access to users" ON users
  FOR ALL TO service_role USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 2. Enhanced Webhook Processing
**Changes**:
- Fixed `processed_events` table policies
- Ensured proper constraint handling for user_orders
- Added comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks

### 3. Package Validation Improvements
**Observations**:
- The existing fallback mechanism in `RoamifyService.createEsimOrderV2()` is working correctly
- System successfully falls back to `esim-europe-30days-3gb-all` when original packages fail
- Recommendation: Implement proactive package validation to prevent 500 errors

## Testing & Verification

### Test Script
**File**: `backend/test_guest_user_fix.js`

**Features**:
- Verifies guest user exists with all required fields
- Tests user_orders creation and foreign key constraints
- Validates processed_events table functionality
- Tests service role permissions
- Includes cleanup of test data

### Running the Test
```bash
cd backend
node test_guest_user_fix.js
```

## Current System Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Email Delivery**: Two-step email flow is working correctly
- **QR Code Generation**: Real QR codes from Roamify are being generated
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe webhooks are being processed successfully
- **Fallback Mechanism**: System gracefully handles package failures
- **Order Completion**: Orders are completing successfully despite early errors

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention
- **Package Mapping**: Some packages have incorrect Roamify IDs
- **Data Consistency**: Consider auditing package-to-Roamify mappings
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for fallback package usage

## Recommendations

### 1. Apply the Migration
Run the new migration to fix guest user issues:
```bash
# Apply via Supabase Dashboard or CLI
supabase db push
```

### 2. Test the Fix
```bash
cd backend
node test_guest_user_fix.js
```

### 3. Monitor Webhook Logs
Watch for:
- Reduced "first_name column not found" errors
- Fewer fallback package warnings
- Successful user_orders creation

### 4. Package Audit (Optional)
Consider running a package validation script to identify and fix package mapping issues:
```bash
node backend/scripts/validatePackages.ts
```

## Expected Improvements

After applying these fixes:
1. **Guest orders will process completely** without schema errors
2. **User_orders tracking will work properly** for all customers
3. **Webhook idempotency will prevent duplicate processing**
4. **Better error handling and logging** for debugging
5. **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing functionality

## Monitoring

Key metrics to track:
- Guest user creation success rate
- User_orders creation success rate
- Webhook processing without errors
- Fallback package usage frequency
- Overall order completion rate

The system is currently functional and delivering eSIMs successfully. These fixes will eliminate the remaining errors and improve reliability for guest orders.
