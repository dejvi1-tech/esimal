  - Seeded Supabase packages table with country-specific Roamify IDs (migration 20250630_seed_packages.sql)
  - Removed all fallback logic in delivery and Roamify services/controllers
  - Added /backend/src/scripts/validatePackages.ts and package.json script for daily validation

  - Updated all links, fetches, and helpers to use slugified country names
  - Updated CountryPage to show empty/error states instead of 404
- [x] Enhance /country/:slug to show both country and region pages (2024-07-11)
  - CountryPage now detects if slug is a country or region, tries country fetch, then region fallback
  - Added decodeSlug and capitalize helpers to src/lib/utils.ts
  - Added/updated unit tests for slug helpers and CountryPage (country, region, empty, error cases)

## [COMPLETED] Switch Roamify V2 order payload to use items array (2025-01-04)
- [x] **TypeScript Interfaces**: Added `RoamifyOrderItem` and `RoamifyEsimOrderRequest` interfaces to `roamifyService.ts`
- [x] **Service Updates**: Updated `createEsimOrder`, `createEsimOrderV2`, and `createOrderV2` methods to use new items array format
- [x] **Payload Structure**: Changed from top-level `{ packageId, quantity, days }` to `{ items: [{ packageId, quantity, days }] }`
- [x] **Default Values**: Added default `days: 30` when not specified to ensure compatibility
- [x] **Testing**: Created `test_roamify_v2_payload.js` to verify new format works and old format fails as expected
- [x] **Backward Compatibility**: All existing method signatures remain unchanged, only internal payload structure updated

## [COMPLETED] Drop days field from Roamify V2 order payload (2024-07-11)
- [x] Removed days property from RoamifyOrderItem and RoamifyEsimOrderRequest interfaces in roamifyService.ts
- [x] Updated createEsimOrder, createEsimOrderV2, and createOrderV2 to no longer send days in the payload
- [x] Updated webhook controller and all usages to remove days from order creation
- [x] Updated test_roamify_v2_payload.js and added test_payload_structure.js to verify correct payload
- [x] Verified build and payload structure; all code, types, and tests now match Roamify V2 API requirements
