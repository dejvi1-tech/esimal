# Scroll Blocking Issue Fix

## Problem Identified

The website was experiencing intermittent scroll blocking issues where vertical scrolling would become disabled, even though navigation buttons worked and the page appeared normal. After a refresh, scroll would work again, but occasionally it would get stuck.

## Root Cause

The main issue was in the `CoverageModal` component, which was setting `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` when the modal opened, but had a race condition in the cleanup logic where the overflow might not be properly restored if the component unmounted unexpectedly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `useScrollLock` Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useScrollLock.ts`)

A safe scroll management hook that:
- Stores the original overflow value before changing it
- Properly restores the original overflow value on cleanup
- Includes additional cleanup effects to ensure overflow is restored when component unmounts
- Provides a `forceRestoreScroll` function for emergency use

### 2. Updated Modal Components

- **CoverageModal**: Updated to use the new `useScrollLock` hook
- **CountryInfoModal**: Updated to use the new `useScrollLock` hook for consistency

### 3. Created Global Scroll Restoration Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/scrollRestoration.ts`)

Provides emergency scroll restoration functions available in the browser console:

```javascript
// Emergency scroll restoration
window.restoreScroll()

// Check scroll status
window.checkScrollStatus()
```

### 4. Enhanced CSS Rules (`frontend/src/index.css`)

Added CSS rules to prevent scroll blocking:
- Ensures `html` and `body` always have `overflow: auto` by default
- Prevents problematic classes from blocking scroll
- Provides emergency override classes

### 5. Global Initialization

The scroll restoration utilities are automatically initialized when the app loads, making the functions available in the browser console.

## How to Use

### For Developers

1. **Use the `useScrollLock` hook** for any new modals or overlays:
```typescript
import { useScrollLock } from '@/hooks/useScrollLock';

const MyModal = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  useScrollLock(isOpen);
  // ... rest of component
};
```

2. **Test scroll restoration** using the test component:
```typescript
import ScrollTestButton from '@/components/ScrollTestButton';

// Add to any page for testing
<ScrollTestButton />
```

### For Users (Browser Console)

If scroll gets stuck, users can:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `window.restoreScroll()`
3. Check status: `window.checkScrollStatus()`

### For Emergency Situations

If scroll is completely blocked, the following CSS can be applied in the browser console:

```javascript
// Force restore scroll
document.body.style.overflow = 'auto';
document.documentElement.style.overflow = 'auto';
document.body.classList.remove('overflow-hidden', 'no-scroll', 'scroll-lock');
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system periodically checks for scroll blocking and warns in the console
2. **Safe Cleanup**: All modal components now use the safe `useScrollLock` hook
3. **CSS Overrides**: CSS rules prevent scroll blocking classes from taking effect
4. **Global Utilities**: Emergency functions available in browser console

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Open the website
2. Open browser console
3. Run: `window.restoreScroll()` (should show success message)
4. Run: `window.checkScrollStatus()` (should show scroll is enabled)
5. Test modal opening/closing to ensure scroll is properly managed

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/CoverageModal.tsx` - Updated to use `useScrollLock`
- `frontend/src/components/CountryInfoModal.tsx` - Updated to use `useScrollLock`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useScrollLock.ts` - New hook for safe scroll management
- `frontend/src/utils/scrollRestoration.ts` - New global utilities
- `frontend/src/index.css` - Enhanced CSS rules
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Imported scroll restoration utilities
- `frontend/src/components/ScrollTestButton.tsx` - New test component

## Benefits

1. **Prevents scroll blocking**: The root cause has been fixed
2. **Safe modal management**: All modals now use safe scroll locking
3. **Emergency recovery**: Users can restore scroll from browser console

## Maintenance

- All new modal components should use the `useScrollLock` hook
- The global utilities are automatically loaded and don't require manual initialization
- CSS rules ensure scroll blocking classes don't take effect
- Regular testing with the test component can verify functionality
